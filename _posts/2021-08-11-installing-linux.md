So searching for a new laptop took me about two weeks... I ended up getting a Thinkpad x1 gen 7. 

Okay. I thought I was ready to try Linux but I hadn't decided what distro I was going to install. To be honest, I kind of knew there were different versions of Linux but didn't know there were so many. Since the school lab machines use Ubuntu, I was thinking about installing Ubuntu. 

And just like when I was choosing a new laptop, I started to research what distro would be good to play with, which took me at least two days. Ubuntu is very user-friendly and there isn't much for me to worry about - just like when I would use macOS.
